## Introduction

American Traveller is a React static front end application meant as a companion piece to my earlier [World Traveller](https://github.com/jlewisbrewer/WorldTraveller). This application was developed fully with [React](https://reactjs.org) with a little web-scraping done with Python's [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) package. A link to the application can be found [here](https://jlewisbrewer.github.io/AmericanTraveller/).
